How to create a file in the folder "Todo" ?

POST /todo 
title: "Buy something" due: 2014-04-01

title: is a tag that is used to add a title.

due: is a tag used for dates

? is always used before the querystring. 
+ is used for a space in the URL
# is used before a fragment is inserted. (A fragment is a pointer to some content on a webpage)

So to create in using POST in I'm Only Resting

To update an entry using PUT

This is also a markup language. You cannot invent your own tags.

Look for a logical and coherent structure.

<!doctype>
<html> (this is to explain that it is a HTML doc)
    <head> 
         <title>This is a Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
         <section>
              <h1>Joe</h1> (This a heading, which will have larger text size. There can up to <h6>)
              <p>078977785674</p> (This is a paragraph, by default it will output using normal spaces between words)
              <p><a href="...">joe@hotmail.com</a> (This tag is generally used to produce links/Anchors, inline.)</p>
              <img src=>
         </section>
    </body>
</html>

<stong>BOLD TEXT</strong> (This is to make the text bold, inline tag)
<b></b>(This will make text bold for keywords)

<em>Emphasized text</em> (This will be used for text you are trying to emphasize, inline.)

<div></div> (can be used to structure and group elements)

<ul></ul> (is an unordered list, only children you can have is <li>.)
<li></li>(is a list item, it is an ordered list. )
<ol></ol>(is an ordered list Order does matter.)
<img src="image.jpg"> (this is an inline tag which will output an image.)
