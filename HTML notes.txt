How to create a file in the folder "Todo" ?

POST /todo 
title: "Buy something" due: 2014-04-01

title: is a tag that is used to add a title.

due: is a tag used for dates

? is always used before the querystring. 
+ is used for a space in the URL
# is used before a fragment is inserted. (A fragment is a pointer to some content on a webpage)

So to create in using POST in I'm Only Resting

To update an entry using PUT

The syntax is not always the same for each server.

Scalability
Created to accommodate for future growth

Performance
Stress testing: is how much can it handle at the maximum.
Load testing:

    * 201 Created
    * 204 No Content
    * 300 (moved resource)
    * 301 redirect
    * 400 (Client error)
    * 404 bad request
    * 403 forbidden
    * 405 method not allowed
    * 500 (server errors)
 
This is also a markup language. You cannot invent your own tags.

Look for a logical and coherent structure.

<!doctype>
<html> (this is to explain that it is a HTML doc)
    <head> 
         <title>This is a Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
         <section>
              <h1>Joe</h1> (This a heading, which will have larger text size. There can up to <h6>)
              <p>078977785674</p> (This is a paragraph, by default it will output using normal spaces between words)
              <p><a href="...">joe@hotmail.com</a> (This tag is generally used to produce links/Anchors, inline.)</p>
              <img src=>
         </section>
    </body>
</html>

<stong>BOLD TEXT</strong> (This is to make the text bold, inline tag)
<b></b>(This will make text bold for keywords)

<em>Emphasized text</em> (This will be used for text you are trying to emphasize, inline.)

<div></div> (can be used to structure and group elements)

<ul></ul> (is an unordered list, only children you can have is <li>.)
<li></li>(is a list item, it is an ordered list. )
<ol></ol>(is an ordered list Order does matter.)
<img src="image.jpg"> (this is an inline tag which will output an image.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<header>,
<main>,
<aside>,
<article>,
<footer>,
<div id = "">
<div class = "">, could change anything and be used anywhere

Create a form in HTML.
<form method = "" action "">
<input type = "text" name = "title" id = "title">
<label for = title> Todo item: </label>

Always have a label tag for an input tag
