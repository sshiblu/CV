                    <p> During the course of my electronics degree, I believe I have demonstrated my abilities both as an individual also as a team player. During the second year, a joint task was given to create an electronic micro mouse that would ultimately traverse an 8 by 8 maze. The mouse itself had both a hardware and software component. Although, my role primarily designated as the programmer I aided in the hardware construction of the mouse such as the motor and sensor circuitry. An MBED board was selected to programme the mouse as it utilised the more versatile C++ language. A &#39;Left Priority&#39; algorithm was then created, where the mouse would primarily sense for an opening in the left wall as opposed to the front and right wall. If an opening is sensed the mouse would carry out the corresponding manoeuvre i.e. a left turn. By using the algorithm the mouse successfully completed the maze. </p>

                <p> Beyond academia, I have a great passion for sports as I find it a great way to alleviate stress. Particularly playing football and snooker. By playing football, I am able to improve my skills as a team player working with other team members in order to carry out a certain objective i.e. defending against the opposition. Whereas, by playing pool/snooker I analyse the situation and try to take the best possible action in a given scenario, thus polishing up my skills as an individual. I am also an avid watcher of comedy and old time vaudeville, such as the stylings of comedic duo Martin and Lewis&#44; Don Rickles and Milton Berle. </p>
